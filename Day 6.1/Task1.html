    <h2 style="color: brown;">‘Don’t Promote Me, Promote Motorsports’</h2>
    <p>
        Ajith Kumar sees racing as a form of therapy and a way to push personal limits, emphasizing that it requires
        intense focus, discipline, and teamwork, and gives a greater appreciation for life. He uses his racing to
        promote Indian cinema globally and to represent India on the international stage, a source of pride for him. He
        has formed a professional racing team, Ajith Kumar Racing, to foster interest in the sport within India and to
        compete at the highest levels of international motorsport.
